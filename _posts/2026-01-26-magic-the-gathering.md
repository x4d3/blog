**Magic: The Gathering** is a strategy card game where players cast spells, summon creatures, and use *mana* (from lands) to reduce opponents from their starting life total to **0**.

## The Basics

* You start with a hand of cards and **20 life**
  *(Commander uses **40** life)*
* You may play **one land per turn**
* Lands produce mana to cast spells
* Creatures attack **players**; opponents block with creatures
* Cards do exactly what they say — no hidden rules

## The Five Colors

* **White** — order, protection
* **Blue** — control, card draw
* **Black** — sacrifice, graveyards
* **Red** — speed, direct damage
* **Green** — big creatures, ramp

## What Is Commander?

**Commander (EDH)** is a multiplayer format (usually **3–5 players**) where each player has:

* A **100-card deck**
* **1 legendary creature** as their Commander
* Only **one copy** of each card
  *(except basic lands)*
* A deck limited to the commander’s **color identity**

**Extra rule:** you lose if you take **21 combat damage from a single commander**.

Your commander starts in the **command zone** and can be cast repeatedly, costing **+2 mana** each time after the first.
